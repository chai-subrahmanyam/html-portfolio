<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!<br/> <img src = "../assets/images/HelloThere.png" height="100" alt = "Picture of General Kenobi saying hello there"/><br />
  I'm Chaitanya Subrahmanyam, a passionate and creative web developer dedicated to crafting visually appealing and functional websites. With a love for coding and a keen eye for design, 
  I'm on a mission to make the web a better place, one line of code at a time.</p>

<p>My journey into the world of web development began in highschool when I took my first webdesign course. Since then web design took a backseat while I got my degree in Mathematics and Minor in Computer Science, I've now come full
 circle and have come back to my original passion: Web Design, I've worked on honing my skills and getting up-to-date
 with the latest industry trends. From taking a web design bootcamp on Udemy to working on extra passion projects, I've had the privilege of learning and growing through each experience.</p>

<p>I specialize in [Your Main Specializations or Technologies], where I blend my technical expertise with a touch of creativity to bring websites to life. 
From responsive front-end design to seamless back-end functionality, I thrive on turning ideas into digital reality. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code 
that not only works flawlessly but also contributes to a positive user experience.</p>

<p>When I take on a project, I believe in [Your Work Philosophy or Approach]. I understand the importance of [Client Satisfaction, User-Centered Design, etc.], and I'm committed to delivering 
solutions that exceed expectations. Every website I create is a result of [Your Creative Process or Methodology], ensuring that it not only looks stunning but also functions seamlessly across devices.</p>

<p>I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals or businesses. Whether you're looking to revamp your 
online presence, create a user-friendly interface, or enhance your website's performance, I'm here to help. Let's join forces to bring your digital vision to life!</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href = "mailto: chai.manyam@gmail.com">Email Me</a>. Whether you have a project in mind or just want to chat about all things web development, I'm just a message away.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website and taking the time to get to know me a little better. I look forward to the opportunity to work together and create something amazing!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Chaitanya</p>
